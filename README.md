What is Pythonic?

To be Pythonic is to use the Python constructs and datastructures with clean, readable idioms. ```It is Pythonic is to exploit dynamic typing for instance```, and it's definitely not Pythonic to introduce static-type style verbosity into the picture where not needed. To be Pythonic is to avoid surprising experienced Python programmers with unfamiliar ways to accomplish a task.

Sometimes I think the condemnation of software as 'unpythonic' may be somewhat unfair and may obscure other positive aspects of the software. A less powerful framework that is ```easy to pick up for a Python programmer may be considered more Pythonic ``` than a far more powerful system that takes more of a time investment to learn

Finally, for another, complementary perspective on what is Pythonic design, try the following in a python interpreter:
``` import this ```
